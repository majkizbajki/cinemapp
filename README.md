# CinemApp

The project was completed as a recruitment task in React Native technology using Typescript. Its main goal was to create a simple mobile app where users can search for movies and check movie details. I used the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to manage the data. The libraries I used were mainly:

-   react-native v0.72.3
-   react-navigation
-   react-redux
-   redux-toolkit (with RTKQ)
-   i18next / react-i18next
-   react-native-paper
-   react-native-reanimated

## Design

The design of the page is based on the custom mockups created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/uccCuR9liVBrO31ygOu5iz/CinemApp?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=fc1ZRmjI5E4NoBa9-1).
